    <h2>16. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. When we make material changes, we will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page;</li>
      <li>Send you an email notification to your registered email address;</li>
      <li>Display a prominent in-App notification prompting you to review and accept the updated Terms before continuing to use the Service.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you do not agree to the modified Terms, you must stop using the Service and may delete your account. Continued use of the Service following the effective date of updated Terms constitutes your acceptance of those Terms.</p>
    <p>For changes that materially limit your rights or expand your obligations, we will provide at least 30 days' notice before the change takes effect.</p>

    <h2>17. General Provisions</h2>
    <h3>17.1 Entire Agreement</h3>
    <p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any additional terms or policies incorporated by reference, constitute the entire agreement between you and SafeDose regarding the Service and supersede all prior agreements, representations, and understandings.</p>

    <h3>17.2 Severability</h3>
    <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. The invalid provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.</p>

    <h3>17.3 No Waiver</h3>
    <p>SafeDose's failure to exercise or enforce any right under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of that right. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of SafeDose.</p>

    <h3>17.4 Assignment</h3>
    <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under them without SafeDose's prior written consent. SafeDose may freely assign these Terms, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, with notice to you.</p>

    <h3>17.5 No Third-Party Beneficiaries</h3>
    <p>Except as explicitly stated in Section 15 (Apple), these Terms do not create any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>

    <h3>17.6 Force Majeure</h3>
    <p>SafeDose shall not be liable for any delay or failure in performance resulting from causes beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, war, terrorism, pandemic, government action, or infrastructure failure.</p>

    <h3>17.7 Language</h3>
    <p>These Terms are provided in English, which is the binding and controlling version. Any translations provided are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation or enforcement of the English version.</p>
