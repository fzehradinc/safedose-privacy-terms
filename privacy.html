  <section id="analytics">
    <h2>10. Analytics and Tracking Technologies</h2>

    <p>You may opt out of analytics tracking by enabling "Limit Ad Tracking" (iOS) or "Opt out of Ads Personalization" (Android) in your device settings. Note that KapsulAI does not use analytics data for advertising purposes; this setting affects system-level tracking.</p>
